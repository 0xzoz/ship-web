# Decisions Log — Ship Web Application

This file tracks significant technical and architectural decisions made during the project.

---

## 2026-01-11 22:00 — Project Planning Documents Created

**Decision:** Created REQUIREMENTS.md, SYSTEM_PLAN.md, and TICKETS.md from approved DESIGN.md

**Rationale:**
- Design phase completed and approved by CEO
- Need structured requirements to guide implementation
- System plan provides architecture blueprint
- Tickets break work into actionable batches

**Impact:**
- Clear roadmap for Codex (Builder) to execute
- All team members aligned on what's being built
- Reduces scope creep and misunderstandings

---

## 2026-01-11 22:00 — Monorepo Architecture

**Decision:** Use monorepo structure with separate frontend (apps/web) and backend (apps/api)

**Rationale:**
- Share TypeScript types/schemas between frontend and backend via /packages/shared
- Single deployment process
- Easier local development
- Smaller team, less overhead from managing multiple repos

**Impact:**
- Need workspace tooling (pnpm workspaces or npm workspaces)
- Shared code lives in /packages/shared
- Single git repo, simpler CI/CD

**See:** SYSTEM_PLAN.md ADR-006

---

## 2026-01-11 22:00 — Tech Stack Selected

**Decision:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ App Router + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- Backend: Node.js/Bun + Express/Hono + Prisma ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL
- State: React Query + Zustand
- Real-time: Socket.io

**Rationale:**
- Next.js App Router is modern, future-proof, with excellent performance
- Tailwind enables rapid UI development matching DESIGN.md tokens
- Radix UI provides accessible, unstyled primitives
- PostgreSQL chosen for relational data integrity and JSONB flexibility
- React Query handles server state caching/invalidation automatically
- Socket.io needed for real-time build progress updates

**Impact:**
- All dependencies must align with these choices
- Team needs to follow Next.js 14 patterns (Server Components, etc.)
- Database migrations managed via Prisma

**See:** SYSTEM_PLAN.md Technology Stack section

---

## 2026-01-11 22:00 — Security Architecture

**Decision:**
- API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12+)
- JWT sessions in HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
- All input validated server-side with Zod

**Rationale:**
- Protecting user API keys is critical (they pay for AI usage)
- Standard security best practices for auth
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
- Zod schemas shared between FE/BE ensure consistent validation

**Impact:**
- Need crypto utilities for API key encryption/decryption
- All protected routes require JWT verification middleware
- Never expose sensitive data in logs or client code

**See:** REQUIREMENTS.md NFR-2: Security

---

## 2026-01-11 22:00 — Database Schema Defined

**Decision:** Created complete schema with 8 tables: users, sessions, oauth_accounts, api_connections, projects, project_files, build_logs, chat_messages

**Rationale:**
- Relational structure reflects user → projects → files hierarchy
- Separate tables for OAuth and session management
- API connections encrypted and user-scoped
- Build logs separate table (auto-delete after 30 days)
- Chat messages stored for discovery/requirements phases

**Impact:**
- Database migrations must be run before backend starts
- Foreign key constraints enforce data integrity
- Indexes optimize common queries (user_id, project_id)

**See:** SYSTEM_PLAN.md Data Model section

---

## 2026-01-11 22:00 — Milestone Structure (4 Milestones, ~12 Batches)

**Decision:**
- M1: Foundation (Batch 1-3) — Auth, dashboard, project CRUD
- M2: AI Integration (Batch 4-7) — Connect AI, Discovery phase
- M3: Build Orchestration (Batch 8-14) — Requirements, Build, Deploy
- M4: Polish & Launch (Batch 15-17) — Accessibility, performance, security

**Rationale:**
- Incremental delivery: each milestone provides value
- M1 gives user auth and project management without AI (testable)
- M2 adds AI connections and discovery (core differentiator)
- M3 completes end-to-end build flow (MVP complete)
- M4 production-ready polish

**Impact:**
- CEO can review progress after each milestone
- Earlier milestones can be tested/validated before later ones
- Scope clearly defined for each phase

**See:** SYSTEM_PLAN.md Milestones section

---

## 2026-01-11 22:00 — Batch 1 Scope Defined (T1-T3)

**Decision:** First batch focuses on monorepo setup, database, and authentication API

**Rationale:**
- Foundation must be solid before building on top
- Authentication required for all protected features
- Database schema needed before any CRUD operations
- Establishes patterns for rest of project

**Impact:**
- T1: Project setup (monorepo, Next.js, backend)
- T2: Database with Prisma ORM and migrations
- T3: Auth service (signup, login, logout with JWT)
- After Batch 1, can build protected frontend features

**See:** TICKETS.md Batch 1

---

## Open Questions for CEO

These decisions need CEO input before implementation:

1. **Authentication library:** next-auth (Auth.js) vs Clerk?
   - next-auth: Self-hosted, free, more control
   - Clerk: Managed service, easier setup, costs $$$
   - **Recommendation:** next-auth for MVP (cost-effective, flexible)

2. **Queue system:** BullMQ (Redis-based) vs pg-boss (Postgres-based)?
   - BullMQ: More features, requires Redis (another dependency)
   - pg-boss: Simpler, uses existing Postgres, fewer features
   - **Recommendation:** pg-boss for MVP (simpler stack)

3. **ORM:** Prisma vs Drizzle?
   - Prisma: Better DX, migrations, studio GUI
   - Drizzle: Better performance, more control, newer
   - **Recommendation:** Prisma (mature, team familiar)

4. **Backend runtime:** Node.js vs Bun?
   - Node.js: Ecosystem maturity, battle-tested
   - Bun: Faster, modern, less mature
   - **Recommendation:** Node.js 20+ for MVP (stability)

5. **File storage:** Filesystem vs S3/R2?
   - Filesystem: Simpler for MVP, free
   - S3/R2: Scalable, requires setup and costs
   - **Recommendation:** Filesystem for MVP, migrate later

6. **Deployment platform priority:** Vercel only vs Vercel + Netlify?
   - Vercel only: Focus, best Next.js integration
   - Both: More flexibility, more complexity
   - **Recommendation:** Vercel only for MVP
